After install set up your .env file, if this not exist you can copy the .env-example file and store like .env file in the root of your antVel intallation. Then change  the variables values with yours.

Be sure to create  your database and define the name and access credentials of it on the .env file.
Then you have to create the Antvel schema running artisan migrate command:

```

```

Or if you want to create the schema and load data for a functional demo you can run:

```
php artisan migrate:refresh --seed
```

```
php artisan key:generate 
```

You need to run ***bower install***, in order to have all the frontend dependencies in your machine. So, go to your antvel directory using command line, as so:

```
bower install
```

At this point you should be able to look at your antvel version running in your browser without problems.

Finally you can get your ***reCaptcha***  environments values here:

https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin#list
```

Fill out the "Register a new site" form in order to obtain the reCaptcha keys

```
RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY, and RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY
```

Put the keys  obtained in the corresponding fields on the .env file. For example:

RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY = antvelRecaptchaPublicKeyObtained

RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY = antvelRecaptchaPrivateKeyObtained
```

***Note:*** If the ```APP_DEBUG == true```, the reCaptcha will not be applied
